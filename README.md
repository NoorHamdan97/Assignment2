You are about to take a lead part in the development of the “OlympicRecord” database, a website that holds information about sports and the athletes participating or observing it in the upcoming 2020 Olympic Games.
In OlympicRecord, users with admin privileges (you) can add a sport that takes place in a city, add an athlete to a sport, confirm medals’ rankings or simply make an athlete an observer of a sport.
OlympicRecord is a smart service that gives you statistics about athletes and recommends sports based on athletes’ similar tastes.
